# GPS RTK Breakout

In less than 30 seconds, GPS RTK Breakout enables you to determine your position, direction, and travel route to any destination on Earth. So, the better the precision, the more! We had to include it on this board since GPS Real Time Kinematics (RTK) has perfected fine-tuning its GPS modules' accuracy to only millimetres!

The GPS-RTK HAT from SB Components enhanced high-precision GPS. The ZED-F9P module from u-Blox, which offers 10mm of 3-dimensional accuracy, is the newest one that it has. The X, Y, and Z coordinates that may be generated using these boards are roughly the width of your fingernail. That is what you just read. High precision GPS requires both a stream of correction data from an RTCM source and a powerful antenna.
